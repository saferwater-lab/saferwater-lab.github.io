We conduct research and offer technical assistance related to monitoring and remediating lead in water in schools and childcares in Massachusetts.

<b> Communities:</b>schools and childcares across Massachusetts

<b> Impacts: </b>directly coordinating testing of more than 1500 schools and childcares in Massachusetts for lead in their drinking water; understanding building factors related detection of lead; assistance in designing program for offering lead remediation for childcares 

<b> Technical Assistance</b>

University of Massachusetts - Amherst provides support to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/aws2.1358">Water-Smart</a>, a program of the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) that engages eligible public and private schools and childcare facilities no-cost drinking water lead testing, along with access to results and solutions for elevated lead levels if found. The program launched in 2016 and is voluntary - there's no state law requiring schools to test for lead in drinking water. 

The program has shown strong participation rates. Nearly 1,300 schools and 500 childcare facilities have participated in the program,

We support this program through:
- Program design 
- Coordinating sampling of facilities
- Facilitating data communication with facilities

<b>Funding</b>

<b>Research</b>

<ul>Associations between building features, water quality, and detected water lead levels.</ul> We have studied which facilities are at highest risk and the factors that may help identify the schools and daycare centers at greatest risk for elevated levels of lead in drinking water. The most telling characteristic for schools in Massachusetts is building age, with facilities built in the 1960s and 1970s—nearly a third of the facilities tested—at the greatest risk for having dangerously high water lead level.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.
