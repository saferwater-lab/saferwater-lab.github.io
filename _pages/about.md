Welcome to the SAFER Water Lab - where we develop Sustainable Approaches For Engineering Resilience in water systems. Our research addresses critical water quality and infrastructure challenges from source to tap, from protecting groundwater sources and optimizing treatment technologies to ensuring safe distribution and reliable household access. We focus research on making water systems more resilient for vulnerable communities, including small and disadvantaged systems, remote communities, and areas facing climate-related disruptions. Through field studies, laboratory experiments, and data-driven analysis, we address issues including intermittent water supply, lead contamination, emerging contaminants, and infrastructure adaptation. Our work spans from household-level interventions to state-wide policy analysis, focusing on translating research into practical solutions that ensure safe, reliable water access for all communities. Based at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, we collaborate with water regulatory agencies, utilities, and communities to build more sustainable and equitable water systems for the future.
